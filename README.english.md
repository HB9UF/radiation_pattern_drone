Antennas calculated either with programs like i.e. MMANA or 4NEC shall be checked and measured with a drone for its real transmission angle and further antenna characteristics. 
Versioned Python sources, compiler scripts for raspi zero W or other documentation presented in Mind Manager files, pdf-files and/or Word files shall be documented for additional project members. 

Variant 1: Equipment rtl_power with transverter in tests and already measured values from 7-14 MHz shall be calibrated against S-Level. First measured realtime date with Python performed, and further analysis of these data still in progress as quick win. 

Variant 2: Equipment raspi zero W to be connected with uSDX (hardware already available on site), and measured data to be selected and displayed with Python to the user under investigation (second opinion). 

First Python training course from Mathias HB9FRV as USKA HamAcademy performed, second Python training already planned. A welcome to an additional team member with Python knowledge is kindly requested. If you would like to join the team, please contact either Daniel HB9GVD or Martin HB9GYF.
