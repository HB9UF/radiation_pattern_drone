Antennas calculated either with programs like i.e. MMANA or 4NEC shall be checked and measured with a drone for its real transmission angle and further antenna characteristics. 
Versioned sources, compiler scripts for ESP32 processor, board's KICAD, Silicon Labs documentation, i.e. documentation for used SDR-chipset or other documentations presented in Mind Manager files, pdf-files and/or Word files shall be documented for additional project members. 

As of May 8, 2021 the SDR PCB has been desinged and reviewed. Within the next days it is planned to be prduced in the factory of China.

Drohne Plan B1 is lighter than 250g and this is the benefit that regulatory requirements can be reached easely.

Drohne Plan B1 can fly so called way points xyz and therefore it seams possible to reach the goal to measure an antenna with zig-zag flights.
